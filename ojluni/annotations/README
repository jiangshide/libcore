This directory contains annotated stub files which can be merged into
the main source files by metalava when it is producing API stubs. This
mechanism is used instead of adding the annotations to the main source
files, to avoid carrying patches against the upstream sources.

Directory structure
===================

libcore/ojluni/annotations/sdk:
 - Contains annotations to be included in the public SDK, for example
   annotations specifying additional details about method contracts.

libcore/ojluni/annotations/sdk/nullability:
 - Contains annotations to be included in the public SDK specifically
   relating to nullability. Adding an annotated stub file to this subdirectory
   will cause the annotations to be validated for correctness and completeness.
